# Description
The following repo contains code for simulating some fairly silly models of parent-child interactions.

## Getting started
Assume access to python version 3.7 and launch a virtual environment and install the requirements.

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may then run the models and use `plot.py` to generate plots
